<h1 id="links-you-need">Links you need</h1>
<p>### A dump collected by Chris Lessard</p>

<p>This collection consists of various links I’ve collected over the years, all of which pertain to on CS, tech and design. I visit some of them almost every day, and have gained a lot from others. They’ve been divided into sections with short descriptions to keep things organized.</p>

<h2 id="general--misc">General &amp;&amp; Misc.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Main_Page">InstallGentoo Wiki</a></p>

    <p>Not actually related to Gentoo Linux; the wiki is a collection of articles published largely by people who frequent 4chan’s technology board. It’s a great resource on tech in general, though it can be as offensive as the actual board, so be warned. You’ll find tons of info on recommended software, operating systems, security/anonymity, programming, customizing your devices (known to them as “ricing”), hardware, etc. It’s a good informal resource that should point you in the right direction for many points of interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">Learn x in y minutes</a></p>

    <p>One of the best resources for quick syntax lookups and general recomendations to suit yourself to the language’s style. They seem to have some information on basic analysis and complexity. I would never learn a language without this at my side for the first month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/#ComArt">Stanford’s <em>The Philosophy of Computer Science</em></a></p>

    <p>Stanford’s overview of philosophical discussion pertaining to Computer Science. It doesn’t go into much depth but serves as a great starting point for a lot of topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.windows93.net/">windows93</a></p>

    <p>The operating system that never was… in your browser!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a></p>

    <p>Jeff Atwood’s blog (one of the inventors of Stack Overflow). He’s a decent writer with a lot of experience worth reading into. He’s can be a bit stuck in his own opinions sometimes, but typically puts out great material.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="challenges--practice">Challenges &amp;&amp; Practice</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></p>

    <p>A huge collections of mathematical problems that can be solved with computer programs. These can be quite difficult, especially if you try to do better than a brute force solution. Solutions will teach you a <em>lot</em> about programming and even more about general mathematics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/">The Python Challenge</a></p>

    <p>A sequence of puzzles designed to be solved with Python. Typically involves looking at the page’s source code - you advance levels by modifying the page’s URL. Be sure to read the intro documentation before getting started. The challenges are loads of fun and will teach you a lot about Python that you wouldn’t otherwise get from an introductory course.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="programming-related-tutorials">Programming Related Tutorials</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">JavaScript for Cats</a></p>

    <p>A simple JS tutorial that teaches the language as though you were a cat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://webglfundamentals.org/">WebGL Fundamentals</a></p>

    <p>A free introduction to WebGL with decent explanations and examples for a variety of topics. It should be more than needed to cover decent ground.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://threejsplaygnd.brangerbriz.net/">threejs Play Ground</a></p>

    <p>An interactive experience with WebGL and the three.js framework to give you a sense of what it’s all about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">A guide to Git (no deep shit)</a></p>

    <p>A straightforward guide that’ll teach you how to use Git. I personally find it best if you know a bit about version control already, but no specific experience is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://hackr.io/">Hackr.io</a></p>

    <p>A repo of tutorials on virtually anything you could think of. I found most of my favorites here, it can be a lot to weed through at times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/index.php">The Linux Command Line</a></p>

    <p>Great tutorial meant to teach you (most) of the ins and outs of linux usage. I actually bought the guy’s book, and I’d recommend it - it’s an easy ready that really puts you up to speed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://hackdesign.org/lessons">Hack Design</a></p>

    <p>An informal online course curated by talented people who want to teach you a <em>lot</em> about design. At the very least, this will give you basic knowledge about everything and then some. If you like self directed learning, this is for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles">A List Apart</a></p>

    <p>A huge collection of great articles written about design and development, providing lots of great insights from a wide range of writers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#">Google’s Material Design spec.</a></p>

    <p>Documentation for a design language developped by Google. It largely applies to Android, but illustrates concepts anyone interested in design would probably want to know. It’s straightforward and well organized, with a nice set of videos to demonstrate key ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://type.method.ac/#">Kern</a></p>

    <p>A game about kerning text. Fun, surprisingly difficult at times. I’m not fully convinced that it actually helps you develop an intrinsic sense for good kerning, but it feels rewarding enough.</p>

        <p> I'm a second year student at the University of Toronto pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science (and maybe even math, we'll see). I'm an all around hacker and tech enthusiast, with long running interests in art and education. </p>

When I'm not programming, I'm usually listening to music, obssessively tweaking my <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">OS of choice</a> or reading into new ideas.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center">Hi, I'm Chris Lessard.</h1>

        <p> I'm a second year student at the University of Toronto pursuing my
            B.Sc. in Computer Science. I'm a developer, tech enthusiast,
            with long running interests in the media, art, music and education.</p>

    <p>
        I was born in Ottawa, having since moved to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Market">
        </a>Toronto</a> for school. I currently work as an editor for
        <a href="http://rucs.ca/">RUCS</a>, a publication of the best undergraduate
        research in Computer Science done at the University of Toronto. I do
        freelance web and android development upon request.

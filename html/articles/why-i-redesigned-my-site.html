        <p>I've redesigned my site four or five times since I first registered the domain a few years back. I would be lying if I said that I don't enjoy working on it, because I really do. I've shown a few of my friends how to set one up, and they're just as hooked as I am.</p>
        
        <p>Though it can feel a bit egotistical at times, it's nice to have your own little corner of the web. It's yours, of course, so you can personalize it however you like. It isn't just a way to present yourself to others, it's a playground in which you experiment with new tools. I've messed around with ideas and frameworks that have taken up residence here over the years. As a result, my site has both complemented and reflected my learning, with each iteration bringing something new.</p>
        
        <p>This version of the site, however, will hopefully be the last. As much as I like tinkering with my site, I always leave it unfinished. Each time I go to update it, I find the codebase so messy that I restart from scratch, with a new framework or design in mind, that I don't take much time to plan out. This is a bad habbit I struggle with when it comes to many of my casual projects, and I'm officially resolving to get over it. I redesigned this site with a very clear idea in mind, and a great reluctancy to take on much more then a basic html and css - because if there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that I hate styling websites.</p>
        
        <p>Frameworks are cool, but I have no reason to use one. I don't particularily want to conform to a Bootstrap template, and I don't have enough content to merrit the use of Skeleton. I used Jekyll for a while, and it's great, but even that's overkill. I really wanted to keep this minimal, and I'm annoyed by the growing trend of "minimal" websites that win design awards for aesthetic beauty despite being near impossible to use.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not trying to bash other web designers. There are a lot of very talented people that do a lot really great work on the web, far better than I ever could. That doesn't change the fact that there are more people who put in a lot of unecessary effort only to inherit countless issues with each additional feature they take on. There's a reason why <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfucking website</a> exists. Oh, and CSS blows. It's a complete nightmare to use. There are people who are amazing at it, and I don't understand why they would willingly commit themselves to such a deep layer of hell. It has so much going on that it's near-impossible to do a lot without wasting a ton of your time. I personally am of the opinion that you shouldn't need to be a master of something to use it effectively, and CSS often falls short in this regard.</p>
        
        <p>You may want to interject at this point and tell me how wrong I am. Look, I get it. I've read the articles, and I've seen the arguments on Hacker News. I understand that there are plenty of frontend techniques that I'm not using, or that more time studying CSS might set things straight. I might be completely wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that a little piece of me dies every time I realize I need to implement a bit of frontend.</p>
        
        <p>That's why I hope this is the last time I redesign my site. I stole most of the styling rules from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>. I picked a nice monospace font and added both color and favicons. I stopped trying to superficially inject content into a wide array of pages, opting instead for the minimum. I looked at a few sites I liked, cherry picked a few features and added them in. The result is easy to maintain, presentable, responsive and, most importantly, complete. I haven't forgotten to implement anything because there wasn't much to do, and that satisfaction is 100% worth it.</p>
        
        <p>This experience actually helped me grow as a developer. I learned that I'd rather have something small, clean and functional than something insanely impressive and hard to maintain. If there's any moral to this story, it's and evaluating your tools can contribute as much to your development as learning new ones can.</p>

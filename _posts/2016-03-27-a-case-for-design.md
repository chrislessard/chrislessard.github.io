Design is an entity that has held my attention for a number of years, ever since I first saw Gary Hustwits 2009 Documentary *Objectified*. The documentary gives an overview of design's importance in our world, visiting several of the field's greats for their professional input.One of my moments in the film explores the subtle beauty inherant in good design: when it is done properly, virtually no one takes note of it. The audience is introduced to the designers of a potato peeler, whose handle is specifically crafted to aid people with arthritis. Whereas most who would purchase the tool wouldn't think twice about its form, those who suffer from the disability are sure to be grateful for it. This is a real driving point for me: if we want to design successfully, we need to consider the extreme scenarios, and let those in between fall into place naturally.There are, in fact, a few essential ways to approach the question of what constitutes good design. Legendary industrial designer Dieter Ram's, outlines a few of the points he believes to be most important as follows:

1. Good design is innovative.
2. Good design makes a useful product.
3. Good design is aesthetic.
4. Good design makes a product understandable.
5. Good design is unobtrusive.
6. Good design is honest.
7. Good design is long-lasting.
8. Good design is thorough.
9. Good design is Environmentally Friendly.
10. Good design is as little design as possible.

At a glance, this can seem quite overwhelming. Rams posits enough rules that they almost seem conflicting, and yet they manage to capture design's subtlety in a rather elegant way. My favourite point is the last; that good design should be as little design as possible. Plenty of tutorials today illustrate glossy effects and aesthetic obsessions, but I believe that they miss the point. The greatest design helps people without them knowing it; and while it may certainly look nice, this is typically icing on the cake. Take a look at this diagram that I grabbed from [some random dude](http://somerandomdude.com/2012/01/10/transition-from-development-to-design/):

We see this kind of structure laid out for us in a very intuitive way. We should aim to present our designs well, but must not lose sight of the fundamental truth that design should ultimately be solving a problem in a way that we can count on.

In my opinion, having read enough about the subject and seen enough documentaries, *a great designer is someone who can understand an issue in a way that no one else has*.

What's more, they can understand the problem so completely that the solution becomes obvious and self-satisfying. In my short time designing things (mostly websites and my writing) I've come to believe that the process should be intuitive, and should be empathetic.
We're in a great time for design: this is where its scope continues to expand far and wide. If software is not designed well, we risk catastrophic system failures. If works of architecture are not designed well, we risk loss of human life. If a potato peeler isn't well made, we risk upsetting someone as they prepare a meal. These issues can be ranked by their urgency, but I believe that the design of their solutions is all equally important. We should take care in solving these problems, so that they cannot persist.Given all this, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that companies like Apple, Amazon, GitHub and Google all place so much emphasis on design. If you want to solve problems - no matter your profession - design should be an element of your domain.

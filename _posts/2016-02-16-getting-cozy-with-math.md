I remember sitting around in my family living room around this time a few years ago, trying to decide what I wanted to go off and study. I was pretty convinced that CS was the only way to go, but as I looked over the requirements for most universities I saw a few things I wasn't too keen on. 

To give you a hint, here are some of the links I most likely visited at that time:

*Where before they were half asleep or simply chilling, now they're wide awake,
their systems streaming with stimulants. Some acts, such as BODYGUARD,
Fatima Al Qadiri, *E+E * Jam City are even venturing beyond pastiche and
into a new, abstract and disorientating sensualism. Yet you could say that
many of these artists are still situated within the world-view of the lo-fi
underground, one in which an authentic, warm and grass-roots music-making is
 pitted against the top-down, cheesy, slick and impersonal technological mainstream.*

Adam Harper for Dummy Magazine, 2012

It's been a few years since Vaporwave - one of the Internet's infamous micro-genres
- came and went. Branching off from short-lived parent genres Chill Wave and Sea Punk
in the late 2000s, Vaporwave's most active proponents set out to dust-off and repackage
 retired commercial recordings from the 1980s and 1990s with newer, smoother
 sonic finishes. The movement picked up speed the moment it began, and before
 long a handful of artists jumped into the "Virtual Plaza" - a term coined by
 then genre-partisan James Ferraro - to release countless free albums under their
 collective label, Beer on the Rug.

Before delving into the foggy corners of the musical sub net, some context
should probably be provided to those unfamiliar with it. In late 2010 Daniel
Lopatin, a New-York based musician now performing under the moniker Oneohtrix
Point Never, released Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, a collection chopped up
and slowed down 80s pop singles. His compilation was released in tangency with
 a handful of singles consisting entirely of hyper smooth, stretched-out
 soundscapes via YouTube upload, and would soon provide the basis for the
 entire Vaporwave movement. Not long after these initial issues, Ferraro
  arrived on the scene, inspired by Lopatin's work, with the intention of
  taking the still unborn movement in a new direction with the release of
  his debut album, Far Side Virtual. This release already marked a decisive
  turning point from Ecojams, pointing the virtual community's attention to
  background music developed by the Muzak Company throughout the 20th century.
  This kind of music came as close to "sonic capitalism" as one could get, and
  lent itself well to Ferarro's efforts to place a greater emphasis on
  Vaporwave's potential for sociological commentary. Ferraro's work seemed to
   both critique and mock the growing presence of Capitalism around the world
    in a hyper-exaggerated way. In addition to this, as Reddit user
    DepartmentStoreSpook puts it, his work "allowed fans to examine the
    disposability of pop music itself"'.

It wasn't long before Vaporwave exploded, with a large array of artists
hosting their work on digital platforms like Soundcloud and Bandcamp.
These musicians, with such extravagant names as Laserdisc Visions,
Macintosh Plus, New Dreams Ltd. and Prismcorp Virtual Enterprises began
uploading huge quantities of music to the net, building off of Ferarro's
vision. The community blossomed for the better part of 2011 and 2012, managing
to keep its audience limited to those familiar with the back alleys of the net.
 But, almost inevitably, their work would eventually breach the public sphere.
 Dummy Magazine's Adam Harper published two part series on Vaporwave in July of
  2012, tackling some of the movements many intricacies. Was the movement indeed
   a critique of Capitalism and disposable music, or a form of embracement?
   According to Harper, "both and neither". Before long, thousands took to Beer
   on the Rug's discography, interpreting it and re-creating it however they would.
    "Vaporwave art" took off on Tumblr, and soon the genre was littered by an endless
     chasm of material. Unfortunately, the movement's enigmatic qualities were
     suspended in time and the floated away before a proper explanation could be
      provided by anyone originally involved in it. Just as soon as it had appeared,
       the original community had dispersed. Many of its associated artists either quit
       altogether or moved onto new projects. New artists began producing knock-offs,
       resulting in a largely ignorable catalogue of musical redundancies and blatantly
       slowed-down tracks. With little understanding for the movement roots, most critics
       dismissed Vapowave altogether, labelling it no more than a pitiful joke.

Though Vaporwave may have ended, its short presence has nevertheless highlighted
some very interesting occurrences in recent popular music. As Kirby Ferguson
notes in his documentary series Everything is a Remix, "Many artists draw from
 their influences, though they tend to emulate a general sound, rather than
 lifting the music directly". This phenomenon, according to him, is part of an
  old trend of what can be called "Legal Remixing". This form of music production
  has dominated the music industry for decades now, and has spawned quite a number
   of famous releases. DJ Shadow became famous in 1999 with the release of his
    album Entroducing, which featured a handful find tuned classic drum samples.
     The bass line in the song "Good Times" by Chic, made popular by the Sugarhill
      Gang's "Rappers Delight", has been sample over [150 times](http://www.whosampled.com/Chic/Good-Times/)
        since its initial release in the 1970s. Nearly every popular hip-hop beat or piece of electronic music is founded upon a sample of someone else's sound. But, even though sampling has almost reached a point where it is more or less essential, we have - for the first time - found ourselves in a period of artistic creativity where entire genres are founded almost purely upon the idea of repurposing 1/ older work. The rise of electronic music production and technical innovation in the field of Computer Science have both allowed artists to simultaneously pay homage and draw inspiration from their favourites tunes in ways never before imagined. Unlike traditional remixes, where a simple element of a song may be altered and re-used on a new track, artists like those involved in the Vaporwave community have taken things to a point where entire songs, if not albums, are repurposed as instruments. These pieces are pitched up or down, chopped up and screwed out - they are glossed over in countless audio effects to a nearly unrecognizable state of being, while still maintaining traces of their original presentation. What's most interesting is that these artists often escape lawsuits either by sheer anonymity, apathy on the part of record companies, or by careful usage of creative commons licensing. They don't tend charge people for their music, meaning that they can put out as much music as they want, whenever they want. The somewhat misunderstood public appeal Vaporwave suggests to us that projects may become great successes with almost no need for “original” creative channelling at all.

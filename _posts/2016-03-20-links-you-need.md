This dump consists of various links I've collected over the years, all of which pertain to on CS, tech and design. I visit some of them almost every day, and have gained a lot from others. They've been divided into sections with short descriptions to keep things organized.

### General && Misc.

1. [InstallGentoo Wiki](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Main_Page)

	Not actually related to Gentoo Linux; the wiki is a collection of articles published largely by people who frequent 4chan's technology board. It's a great resource on tech in general, though it can be as offensive as the actual board, so be warned. You'll find tons of info on recommended software, operating systems, security/anonymity, programming, customizing your devices (known to them as "ricing"), hardware, etc. It's a good informal resource that should point you in the right direction for many points of interest.

2. [Learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

	One of the best resources for quick syntax lookups and general recomendations to suit yourself to the language's style. They seem to have some information on basic analysis and complexity. I would never learn a language without this at my side for the first month.


4. [Stanford's *The Philosophy of Computer Science*](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/#ComArt)

	Stanford's overview of philosophical discussion pertaining to Computer Science. It doesn't go into much depth but serves as a great starting point for a lot of topics.


3. [windows93](http://www.windows93.net/)

	The operating system that never was... in your browser!

### Blogs

1. [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)

	Jeff Atwood's blog (one of the inventors of Stack Overflow). He's a decent writer with a lot of experience worth reading into. He's can be a bit stuck in his own opinions sometimes, but typically puts out great material.

### Challenges && Practice

1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

	A huge collections of mathematical problems that can be solved with computer programs. These can be quite difficult, especially if you try to do better than a brute force solution. These will teach you a *lot* about programming and even more about general mathematics.

2. [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)

	A sequence of puzzles designed to be solved with Python. Hints typically come by looking at the page's source code - you advance levels by modifying the pages URL's. Be sure to read the intro documentation before getting started. The challenges are loads of fun and will teach you a lot about Python that you wouldn't otherwise get from an introductory course.

### Programming Related Tutorials
1. [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

	A simple JS tutorial that teaches the language as though you were a cat.

2. [WebGL Fundamentals](http://webglfundamentals.org/)

	A free introduction to WebGL with decent explanations and examples for a variety of topics. It should be more than needed to cover decent ground.

3. [threejs Play Ground](http://threejsplaygnd.brangerbriz.net/)

	An interactive experience with WebGL and the three.js framework to give you a sense of what it's all about.

3. [A guide to Git (no deep shit)](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

	A straightforward guide that'll teach you how to use Git. I personally find it best if you know a bit about version control already, but no specific experience is required.

4. [Hackr.io](http://hackr.io/)

	A repo of tutorials on virtually anything you could think of. I found most of my favorites here, it can be a lot to weed through at times.

5. [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

	Great tutorial meant to teach you (most) of the ins and outs of linux usage. I actually bought the guy's book, and I'd recommend it - it's an easy ready that really puts you up to speed.

### Design
1. [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/lessons)

	An informal online course curated by talented people who want to teach you a *lot* about design. At the very least, this will give you basic knowledge about everything and then some. If you like self directed learning, this is for you.

2. [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles)

	A huge collection of great articles written about design and development, providing lots of great insights from a wide range of writers.

3. [Google's Material Design spec.](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#)

	Documentation for a design language developped by Google. It largely applies to Android, but illustrates concepts anyone interested in design would probably want to know. It's straightforward and well organized, with a nice set of videos to demonstrate key ideas.

4. [Kern](http://type.method.ac/#)

	A game about kerning text. Fun, surprisingly difficult at times. I'm not fully convinced that it actually helps you develop an intrinsic sense for good kerning, but it feels rewarding enough.
